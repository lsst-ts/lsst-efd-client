This guide describes how to use the EFD client to access and analyze telemetry data from the Rubin Observatory.

Rubin Observatory generates large volumes of `telemetry data`_ stored in the Engineering and Facilities Database (EFD). This data supports real-time monitoring of the observatory systems at the Summit and is replicated to the US Data Facility (USDF) for long-term storage and analysis.

The EFD client provides access to these datasets through the `Rubin Science Platform`_.
